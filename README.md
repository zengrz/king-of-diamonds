King of Diamonds is a mult-player, number-guessing game. The rules of the game is as follow:

1. Each player submit a integer number between 0-100 inclusive.
2. Take the average of the values and multiply by 0.8 to get `x`. Person with guess closest to the value `x` wins.

This constitutes one round. Each player starts with 0 points, player with -10 points is eliminated. A new rule is introduced with each eliminated player.

To make the best approximation, each player has to anticipate guesses of the other players. The game is based on Keynesian Beauty Contest and has applications in trading.
