King of Diamonds is a mult-player, number-guessing game. The rules of the game is as follow:

1. Each player submit a integer number between 0-100 inclusive.
2. Take the average of the values and multiply by 0.8 to get `x`. Person with guess closest to the value `x` wins.

This constitutes one round. Each player starts with 0 points, player with -10 points is eliminated. A new rule is introduced with each eliminated player.
